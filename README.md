# Capstone_Project
This repo contains the report and poster submitted for my degree capstone project.

For this project, I worked at Talley's Group to migration their existing legacy food processing master data management application to modern technology. This modernised the system from VB6 to a React web client and C# .NET + EF Core API.

The report and poster can be viewed in a PDF viewer [here](https://jayden-htn.github.io/Capstone_Project/).
